# Lecture I: Liquid Haskell Overview  
## Intro.lhs: Description of simple refinement types that encode pre- and post-conditions to avoid division by zero.  
## List.lhs: Description of Measures and standard program properties, i.e., termination and totality.   
## SortedList.lhs: Description of refinements on data types to encode inductive properties, like sortedness. 
### Extra verifies sorting algorithms: InsertSort.lhs, MergeSort.lhs, GHCSort.lhs.  
## ListTheorems.lhs: is an intro to theorem proving potential of Liquid Haskell that proves associativity and distributivity of list append.
